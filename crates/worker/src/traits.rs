//! Traits for the chain worker to interface with the underlying system.
//!
//! The worker's dependencies split into four concerns, each backed by a
//! distinct subsystem in production:
//!
//! - [`L1BlockProvider`] — reads L1 data from the Bitcoin node (blocks, txs, network).
//! - [`AnchorStateStore`] — persists and loads [`AsmState`].
//! - [`ManifestMmrStore`] — manifest persistence and the manifest-hash MMR.
//! - [`AuxDataStore`] — per-block [`AuxData`] for prover consumption.
//!
//! [`WorkerContext`] is the umbrella that combines all four. It has a blanket
//! impl, so an implementor just implements the four concern traits and gets
//! `WorkerContext` for free; consumers that only need one concern can depend on
//! the narrower trait instead of the whole context.
