//! SSZ types for checkpoint subprotocol.
//!
//! This crate provides SSZ-serializable types for:
//! - Checkpoint payloads posted to L1
//! - Checkpoint claims used for proof verification
//!
//! # Checkpoint Claim and Payload Relationship
//!
//! [`CheckpointClaim`] represents the complete public parameters for ZK proof verification.
//! It claims that in a checkpoint epoch:
//! - OL executed blocks with [`L2BlockRange::start`] as the parent (last verified) and
//!   [`L2BlockRange::end`] as the final block
//! - All ASM manifests (logs emitted per L1 block) consumed in order are represented by
//!   [`CheckpointClaim::asm_manifests_hash`]
//! - All output messages produced are in [`CheckpointSidecar`] (hashed as
//!   [`CheckpointClaim::ol_logs_hash`])
//! - The [`CheckpointClaim::state_diff_hash`] is the hash of the state diff in
//!   [`CheckpointSidecar`] between [`L2BlockRange::start`] and [`L2BlockRange::end`]
//! - The [`CheckpointClaim::terminal_header_complement_hash`] commits to
//!   [`CheckpointSidecar::terminal_header_complement`], which carries the four terminal header
//!   fields not derivable from L1 checkpoint data (`timestamp`, `parent_blkid`, `body_root`,
//!   `logs_root`). The ZK proof binds this hash to the executed terminal header, so the L1 verifier
//!   can enforce sidecar integrity without a full header preimage check
//!
//! [`CheckpointPayload`] posted to L1 omits redundant information:
//! - The last verified [`OLBlockCommitment`](strata_identifiers::OLBlockCommitment) (L2 start) is
//!   already stored in ASM's checkpoint state
//! - Includes L1 height to identify which L1 blocks were processed up to this checkpoint
//!
//! ASM reconstructs the full [`CheckpointClaim`] by combining:
//! - [`CheckpointPayload`] data (new tip, L1 height, state diff, logs)
//! - Last verified OL block commitment from ASM's checkpoint state
//! - ASM manifests fetched from auxiliary data using the L1 height range, then hashed to compute
//!   `asm_manifests_hash`
//!
//! This minimizes L1 data costs while maintaining full verifiability.
