//! Withdrawal commands define the Bitcoin outputs that operators should create

/// This structure instructs operators on how to construct the Bitcoin transaction
/// output when processing a withdrawal. It currently contains a single output specifying the
/// destination and amount, along with the operator fee that will be deducted.
///
/// ## Fee Structure
///
/// The operator fee is deducted from the withdrawal amount before creating the Bitcoin
/// output. This means the user receives the net amount (withdrawal amount minus operator
/// fee) in their Bitcoin transaction, while the operator keeps the fee as compensation
/// for processing the withdrawal.
///
/// ## Future Enhancements
///
/// - **Batching**: Support for multiple outputs in a single withdrawal command to enable efficient
///   processing of multiple withdrawals in one Bitcoin transaction
