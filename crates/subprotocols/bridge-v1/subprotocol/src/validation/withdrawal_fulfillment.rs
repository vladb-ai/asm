/// # Parameters
///
/// - `withdrawal_info` - Parsed withdrawal information containing deposit details and amounts
///
/// # Returns
///
/// - `Ok(())` - If the withdrawal is valid according to assignment information
/// - `Err(WithdrawalValidationError)` - If validation fails for any reason
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns error if:
/// - No assignment exists for the referenced deposit
/// - The withdrawal specifications don't match the assignment
