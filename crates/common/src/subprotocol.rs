//! Subprotocol trait definition for ASM.
//!
//! This trait defines the interface every ASM subprotocol implementation must
//! provide. Each subprotocol is responsible for parsing its transactions,
//! updating its internal state, and emitting cross-protocol messages and logs.

/// Trait for defining subprotocol behavior within the ASM framework.
///
/// Subprotocols are modular components that can be plugged into the ASM to handle
/// specific transaction types and maintain their own state within the anchor state.
/// Each subprotocol defines its own transaction processing logic, message handling,
/// and state management.
///
/// The ASM filters SPS-50 transactions by subprotocol ID and passes only the relevant
/// transactions to each subprotocol. Each subprotocol does the following, in order:
///
/// 1. processes its transactions to update its own state, create inter-protocol messages to be
///    consumed by other subprotocols, and emit logs,
/// 2. receives incoming inter-protocol messages from other subprotocols to finalize and serialize
///    its state for inclusion in the global AnchorState.
///
/// The ASM design assumes subprotocols are not adversarial against each other, so no additional
/// validation is performed on incoming messages.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// struct MySubprotocol;
///
/// impl Subprotocol for MySubprotocol {
///     const ID: SubprotocolId = 42;
///     type State = MyState;
///     type InitConfig = MyInitConfig;
///     type Msg = MyMessage;
///
///     fn init(config: &Self::InitConfig) -> Self::State {
///        // init logic
///     }
///
///     fn pre_process_txs(
///         state: &Self::State,
///         txs: &[TxInputRef],
///         collector: &mut AuxRequestCollector,
///     ) {
///         // Pre-process transactions and request auxiliary data
///     }
///
///     fn process_txs(
///         state: &mut Self::State,
///         txs: &[TxInputRef],
///         header_vs: &HeaderVerificationState,

///         // Process messages
